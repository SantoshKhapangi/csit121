<p>The Voice of Nepal is a Nepalese reality show and the 
    Nepalese format of the international TV singing reality 
    series called The Voice. The show usually has four
     different coaches (judges), who eventually form four 
     different teams after the selection event called the 
     Blind Audition. Each team has to go through the battle 
     round where contestants are paired with one another 
     within the same team and only half of the total selected contestants from the blind audition are selected for the knockout round. During the knockout round, based on The Voice format, only the best and strongest contestants who their respective coach consider the best overall are selected by their coaches. They also have the sole right to do this on his or her own and take them to the live round (Voting Round). During the live round event, through a series of voting episodes, only one contestant with the most popular vote will advance to the grand finale.
